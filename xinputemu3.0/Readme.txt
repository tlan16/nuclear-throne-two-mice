The xinput dll can go by several names, you can rename the dll to those below till you find one that works
xinput9_1_0.dll
xinput1_3.dll
xinput1_2.dll
xinput1_1.dll

GTAIV uses xinput9_1_0.dll
GTAIV v1.1 info:
Use included dinput8.dll


Look at included xbox360cemu.ini for config help

Installation:
Extract xinput1_3.dll, xbox360cemu.ini file to the game exe directory.
Rename DLL if needed
Extract dinput8.dll file to the game exe directory if you want to hide your controller from the game.
**DO NOT REPLACE SYSTEM FILES**

Uninstallation:
Delete xbox360cemu.ini, xinput1_3.dll file.

Usage:
When the game starts you should hear a beep from your PC speaker.  
If you do not have a PC speaker you may not hear the beep, but it will still work.
